# Algorithm_DataStructure_Playground
This is a little repo that created for me to practice DS and Algorithm

Source -- Catchup with DS and Algorithm within a month:
https://www.quora.com/How-can-I-make-a-schedule-for-learning-DS-and-algorithms-in-one-month

Day 1 - 2 -- Basic Structure (insertion, deletion, search):
- stack
- queues
- Single linked list

Day 3 - 6 -- Binary search tree:
- search
- insertion
- deletion
- BFS
- DFS

Day 7 - 10 -- Graph:
- directed
- undirected
- joint
- disjoint

Day 11 -> :
- to be continued...
